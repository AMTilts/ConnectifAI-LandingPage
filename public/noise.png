# This is a placeholder action.
# You would need to add an actual subtle noise texture image file
# named 'noise.png' to the 'public' directory of your Next.js project
# for the noise overlay effect in AnimatedImagePlaceholder.tsx to work visually.
# You can find noise textures online or generate one.
# For now, the code includes it, but the visual effect requires the file.
